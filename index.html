				<h5><strong>My Story<br></strong></h5>
                <p>
                    When I first moved to the United States from South Korea, I did not know a lick of
                    English other than a single sentence: "I don't speak English." In the hopes of getting my brothe
                    r and I assimilated and adjusted as quickly as possible, my parents had intentionally moved
                    to an area away from Los Angeles where most Koreans in Southern California reside. With the hel
                    p of one Korean friend in my class, I was able to quickly learn a new language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost 20 years later, I am yet again in an almost identical situation. I am currently immersed in
                    the process of learning a new language. Actually, make that several new languages. I have already
                    graduated from a 60-day full-immersion coding program and currently looking for a place that I c
                    an get real world experience from great mentors. I've realized what I have learned in the past
                    four months has only cracked open the lid on Pandora's Box that is the world of web development.
                    And I absolutely cannot wait to find out the wonders (and pitfalls) within. I've worn different
                    hats in my life from a thinking cap (Astrophysics major at UCLA) to a kevlar helmet (United
                    States Marine Corps). I think I have found one in coding that I want to wear for the rest of my
                    life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you just so happen to be looking for someone to offload some of your knowledge, (cause I know
                    sometimes being a genius is hard - from what I've heard), I am your man. Reach out to me!

                        <p>
                            Memorial Day is, as almost all holidays have become, a day of gathering
                            for barbeques and enjoying the company of your close ones. We should always remember, tho
                            ugh, that for too many of the wives, husbands, and children today simply isn't a day of
                            celebration, but a day for remembrance of those who made a conscious decision to put th
                            eir lives at risk for the greater good. Put aside for a moment all of the political
                            reasons and ramifications of why our servicemen and women are overseas. I was in the Mari
                            nes, and I can tell you we don't care about any of that. What we care about is fighting f
                            or that guy next to us. I can tell you I would have gladly taken a bullet for any one o
                            f my platoon mates and they'll say the same. At the same time, I didn't set out to br
                            owbeat anyone when I decided on the topic. After all, all those who gave their lives s
                            erving the country did so believing that they are making a difference for those loved
                            ones that he or she left behind at home. So on this day let's not be afraid to live our lives to its fullest. Enjoy and play hard and also work hard. Let's
                            return the favor. Let's make an imprint on this world during the short time we are here. Who
                            knows? Maybe one day we can make someone's day just a little bit brighter.

					<img src="assets/images/DevConf1(crop).jpg" alt="">
					<div class="caption">
                        <p class="date">May 23, 2014</p>
                        <p>
                            At the crack of dawn we boarded the BART headed for San Francisco
                            . Every one of my cohorts were tired from lack of sleep but I think we all shared the sam
                            e sentiment. We were all very excited to be able to attend our very first HTML5 Develop
                            ers Conference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we arrived as volunteers, we were each given small tasks t
                            o perform: Bill, Jose and Taylor directed traffic, Peter and I scanned people in as they
                            entered the lobby. To check people in, we were asked to download an app that enabled
                            us to either use our phones' camera to scan the QR code on the attendee's tickets or lo
                            ok him/her up by their names. Cool, but pretty tame stuff, I thought. After all,
                            this WAS the conference for all things web and apps. IN SAN FRANCISCO. As it turns out,
                            perhaps due to past experiences, I had more than a few people who seemed very impressed by
                            the app which I found to be both confusing and amusing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After about a couple hours of checking people in furiously,
                            we were cut loose! Our HTML5 conference was about to begin!! First thing we did was scan
                            the big board of presentations to see which ones we wanted to attend. The topics ran the
                            gamut from browser security to online gaming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first and, in my opinion, the best part of the day was the
                            very first presentation of the day: Famo.us. Famo.us is a developer's tool to build th
                            e most beautiful web apps using a physics engine rather than relying on CSS alone.  It is
                            written entirely in JavaScript (JavaScript FTW!), and had just been released to the pu
                            blic just three days ago. The presentation showcased the physics engine and it was by
                            far the most exciting and beautiful things I had seen in a while. I came out of it insp
                            ired that this has to be something that I have to include in my repertoire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After lunch, we had decided that it would be a good idea to
                            go down to where the vendors were to checkout the swag. What was intended to be a goodies
                            hunt, turned out to be the most exciting part of the day. The booths were occupied by bot
                            h tech industry giants like IBM, GE, and Sony and startups like Ludei, and CouchBase. T
                            he most exciting part was that out 20 or so companies being represented there, all but a
                            couple were all looking for developers! In fact, IBM had 1000 positions that needed to be
                            filled. That was NOT a typo. 1000 jobs! Not company wide, not including all the various d
                            epartments. Just 1000 developers. It's one thing to hear from people who are "in the know
                            " about the job market. It's quite another to actually hear it from the companies
                            themselves. Suffices to say that it was a well-needed confirmation that I'm doing the right thing. What a way to wrap up an amazing day.

                    <h3 class="blog-title">How to Set Up a MEAN Stack Project</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/YeomanLogo(crop).png" alt="">
					<div class="caption">
                        <p class="date">May 20, 2014</p>
						<p>
                            On my last post, I very briefly went over my experiences with the MEAN stack and a little
                            bit of the why it was gaining popularity. Today I decided to take the more practical route
                            to show how to set up a MEAN stack project from the ground up. As you will see,
                            most of the work has been done already and all you have to do is to enter just a couple of
                            command line prompts. The process is relatively painless and I will take you through the
                            steps here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The very first step is going to be installing Node. You can do this by going to the <a
                                href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> website and hitting install. Pretty simple, right?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once that's installed, the next thing you are going to do is open up your terminal and type:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            npm install -g yo
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you get an "EACCESS" error, that just means you have to type in 'sudo' in front of npm and
                            then type in your machine's password to gain access. Keep in mind, in the terminal, you won't
                            see anything happen when you type your password. It threw me off in the beginning, too. You
                            definitely are not alone. What that last command did was install a scaffolding tool called <a
                                href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a> that does all of the heavy lifting for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once that's done installing, and you will know when it's done when your command prompt comes
                            back, you will install the scaffolding of your app by typing in the command prompt:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            npm install -g generator-meanstack
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            See how simple that is? Yeoman will now install and organize all the necessary files for you
                            and the only thing left to do is just type:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            yo meanstack
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            to create your very own web app using the MEAN stack. To launch your new app in your local
                            browser, type:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            grunt
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            in to the terminal and go to localhost:3000 to check out the app! There you have it! If you
                            followed along, this
                            probably was the easiest thing you did all day. Now fill it in with some content and enjoy!

                        <p>
                            For about the past week and a half, we have been learning the MEAN stack,
                            so I'm going to discuss a little bit about my experiences dealing with just one small,
                            but pretty major part of the MEAN stack that is NodeJS.
                            <br />
                            First off, for those who don't know what the MEAN stack is, it is an abbreviation describing
                            the four technologies that make up the "stack" or a structure of programming languages. It
                            consists of:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            MongoDB - A NoSQL database that uses JSON documents to represent data
                            <br />

                            Now, if you haven't noticed already, it's pretty clear why the MEAN stack is gaining
                            popularity among developers. The entire stack is written in Javascript. This means that
                            everything is lightening fast since none of the effort goes into translating between
                            different languages. Another main reason is that the heart of the stack, Node.js, working in
                            tandem with Express.js, is very lightweight and fast. It uses callback functions to listen
                            within an event loop for a request to come in, all the while executing other commands.
                            <br />
                            It isn't without it's shortcomings, however. Well, it isn't so much the issue with the
                            language, as much as it is about lack of relevant documentation and usage. After all, node.js
                            hasn't even hit version 1.0 yet. Trying to learn the most cutting edge technology does have
                            its drawbacks by virtue of it being so new and shiny. When it works, it is a thing of beauty.
                            But, when it decides it no longer wants to play nice with you, don't be surprised if you have
                            a hard time finding an answer for it.
                            <br />
                            But this shouldn't discourage anyone from trying to learn it. Just look at it this way, the
                            sooner you start learning and figuring out how node.js works, the better you will be
                            prepared. Ruby on Rails may be the darling right now, but the newborn node.js is growing up
                            fast and already vying for its share of the attention. Don't say I didn't warn you.

                            I guess it would be hard for me to complain about the opportunity I've been given by
                            being here at Coding House. And this definitely isn't one. What I do want to talk about
                            tonight, though, is motivation.
                            <br />
                            It has always been a weakness of mine (yes, I am fully aware that this blog post is gonna be
                            out there for my potential employers to see) to be motivated. Like so many others, in the
                            beginning when one is full of hope and dreams, I am excited and rearing to go. But it seems
                            for me I lose the momentum somewhere along the way. So I end up looking for additional
                            motivators. I look at some of my friends who don't seem to have the same problem and feel
                            like I'm missing something. But maybe, just maybe, there isn't.
                            <br />
                            Everyone goes through the same things in life. Everyone has their struggles and tribulations.
                            I know there are people out there just like me. So this post is for all of you out there.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            1. Self-doubt is natural, but don't let it overwhelm you. Everyone has weaknesses but don't
                            let your weakness define you. Successful people don't dwell in the past. They only think
                            about the present and the near future because as much as we would all want to change the
                            past, no one has that ability. So why bother?
                            <br />
                            2. One thing I definitely need improvement on is asking questions. No one has all the
                            answers, and neither do you. Asking questions doesn't mean you are stupid, it just means that
                            you don't have the answers but you are in search of more knowledge.
                            <br />
                            3. For the love of god, stop comparing yourself with others. It is quite possibly the most
                            asinine and least efficient thing you can possibly do. There will always be people better
                            than you at any given thing at any given moment.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            So I don't know if you have already noticed or not, but this post was just as much for me as
                            it was for whomever out there who needs it. This started from the quote I read that is now the
                            header of my post. Writing about this definitely is something you can try yourself. I know it
                            has helped me greatly. Now it's time to get back to work!!

                            Wow it has been too long since I've visited my blog. It is definitely a weird feeling
                            looking back only three weeks ago, the first week seemed like an eternity. Now I am
                            overwhelmed by the breakneck speed at which the minutes seem to be flying.
                            <br />

                            Yesterday, the entire Coding House family went out to Half Moon Bay about an hour's wor
                            th of drive west from Fremont. In a month's time, all of us have become such close membe
                            rs of what I'll call a very diverse family. Taylor from Shelton, Washington is adjus
                            ting quite well to the fact that he is a minority for the first time in his life. The
                            non-caucasian caucus, which consist of three Asians and Jose(who I have no clue on w
                            hom he identifies himself with), tend to pick on him a little bit due to the fact he is w
                            hite and is from a small town that no one has heard of. But then again, with five guys l
                            iving in a house, no one is safe. Jose from Lubbock, Texas, is slowly coming out of his
                            shell. I think he's closest to the way I am around a new group of people. He is turni
                            ng out to be quite a comedian.  Bill and Peter have quickly become the front runners in
                            the class.  They seem to be grasping the subject matter faster than the rest of us.  I
                            wish I could be that way but it seems I am a little bit slow on the uptake.  I just need to work a little bit harder, but I can't help but feel that I don't
                            know much, but I've always had a very high threshold for my comfort level. But, I digress. Sunday Fun day was such a blast. It was my very first time on a paddle board and
                            I was very shaky to say the least(my aquaphobia didn't help) but I survived which didn't
                            involve staying dry and dare I say, had quite a bit of fun.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            After a grabbing a quick lunch at Nick's favorite sandwich shop, we took the scenic rou
                            te winding through the woods. Of course, Nick had the bright idea of recording yet again
                            of our interpretation of Hall and Oates' You Make My Dreams, a capella no less because we
                            didn't have any cell signal. With each day that passes by, one thing is becoming very c
                            lear - the lesson we are learning isn't just about how to make a web page work, but it
                            is learning to overcome those things that which make us uncomfortable. The biggest o
                            ne of them all for me is going to be being comfortable with the fact that I will be putt
                            ing myself and my body of work out there to be judged while not being as perfect as I
                            would like to be. This will, by far, be the biggest hurdle I will have to overcome in ord
                            er to, in the words of Darryl Hall, "make my dream come true."

                            My first week at Coding House is coming to an end, and it's definitely been a shock to the
                            system. Very similar to the way I felt when I first entered boot camp. The overwhelming
                            feeling of being out of place that filled my mind didn’t really leave much room for anything
                            else. But as the days passed, seeing the familiar faces day after day started to put my mind
                            at ease.  Being part of such small (and which I am sure also will soon be a tight-knit)
                            group, it was daunting for me to let my guard down. Soon I realized, though, that not only
                            is it beneficial but necessary for me to be successful here and when I enter the workforce.
                            It seems the very first lesson I have learned isn't about HTML or JavaScript, it is about
                            being self-sufficient but being humble enough to know when to ask for help.
